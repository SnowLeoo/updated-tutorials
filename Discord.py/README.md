## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed the lastest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### 1. Create the project and install all dependencies
Open your terminal in the folder you want to store the bot in.
``` BASH
# Check if Python is installed
python --version
# Create main.py file
# Install the discord.py package
pip install discord
```
#### 2. Get the bot token
Now get your token from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and save it to your clipboard. We will need it later for the bot.
